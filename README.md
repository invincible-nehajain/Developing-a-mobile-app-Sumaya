# 📱 Developing a Mobile App – Sumaya

Welcome to the **Sumaya Mobile App** project repository! This project focuses on designing, developing, and delivering a high-quality mobile application using a combination of **Waterfall** and **Agile** methodologies.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Sumaya** is a mobile application designed to [briefly describe app purpose, e.g., “enhance productivity by organizing tasks seamlessly”].  
The project aims to deliver a user-friendly, scalable, and visually appealing app across multiple platforms.

---

## 🛠 Methodologies Used

We adopted a **hybrid approach** combining **Waterfall** and **Agile** to leverage the strengths of both methodologies:

- **Waterfall**: For initial requirement gathering, system design, and project planning.  
- **Agile (Scrum)**: For development cycles, sprint planning, and iterative delivery.

## 📊 Gantt Chart

A Gantt chart was created to **visualize the project timeline**, track dependencies, and monitor progress. It helps in:

- Ensuring timely completion of tasks  
- Managing dependencies efficiently  
- Providing a clear roadmap to stakeholders

## 💰 Cost Management & Earned Value Analysis

Effective project cost tracking and performance measurement were implemented using **Excel-based tools and used formulas**:

- **Cost Estimation**:  
  Detailed cost estimates were prepared using Excel to track budgets across project activities, resources, and timelines. This ensured accurate forecasting and proper allocation of funds.

- **Earned Value Chart**:  
  An **Earned Value Management (EVM)** chart was created to monitor project performance and progress against planned costs and schedule.  
  This allowed the team to:  
  - Track **budget variance (BV)** and **schedule variance (SV)**  
  - Measure **cost performance index (CPI)** and **schedule performance index (SPI)**  
  - Make data-driven decisions to keep the project on track

## 🏃 Sprint Planning & Retrospective

Agile practices were implemented through **sprints**, including:

- **Sprint Planning**: Tasks were broken down into manageable stories, prioritized, and assigned to team members.  
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Quick check-ins to ensure progress and remove blockers.  
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflection sessions conducted at the end of each sprint to identify successes, challenges, and improvements for the next cycle.

## 📁 Features Implemented

During the development of **Sumaya**, the following key features were implemented:

- User authentication and authorization  
- Real-time data synchronization  
- Push notifications  
- Interactive UI/UX design  
- Integration with third-party APIs  

---

## 📈 Achievements & Learning

- Successfully delivered app features within the planned sprint cycles  
- Improved team collaboration through Agile ceremonies  
- Learned to balance **Waterfall planning** with **Agile execution** for maximum efficiency  
- Gained experience in creating detailed project timelines and retrospectives
